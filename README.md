# Hangman-Game

In this project, I created a game where the user attempts to guess the name of a classical composer in the style of Hangman.
To get started you need to press any key. Then start guessing by typing letters that correspond to the composer. You have only 15 guesses to name the composer. If you guessed correctly – you win! And the music of guessed composer will play. The heading will change to the composer you guessed. So you will know which composers music is playing now. If you would like to pause music press pause button. If you would like to listen to classical music while you play, you can press the play music button.
