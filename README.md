# Hangman-Game

In this project, I created a game where the user attempts to guess the name of a classical composer in the style of Hangman.
To get started you need to press any key. Then start guessing by typing letters that correspond to the composer. You have only 15 guesses to name the composer. If you guessed correctly â€“ you win! And the music of guessed composer will play. If you would like to pause music press purse button. If you would like to listen to classical music while you play, you can press the play music button.
